Have you ever experienced getting lost when you hit the back button? Like, all of a sudden, you stare at your screen and you wonder where you were looking at on the current page. This happened to me far too often when I was on wiki. After several hops away from the original wiki page, I went back to the original page, then I found myself lost, trying to get back to where I was reading originally.

With WhereWasI? chrome extension, you can Locate the last link you clicked on the current page, by clicking on the WhereWasI icon, or by simply stroking ctrl+shift+f 

Try it now!
